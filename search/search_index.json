Learn More Signals and Systems Wireless Communication System over N-Byte AES Encrypted Channel (Aug 2022 - Jan 2023) Traditional walkie-talkie broadcasts voice signal over a carrier signal. As the voice signal is directly transmitted and can easily be heard through any demodulator, it is impossible to use it in one-to-one communications. If we convert this analog voice signal into digital signal and encrypt it with common shared key, it is possible to save transmitted data from anyone in-between. Guitar Tuner Device using Arduino (Jun 2022) To tune a guitar, each string should be played one by one and the signal it creates should be compared with the ideal signal of that string and adjust accordingly. The goal of the project is to detect which string is playing by capturing the signal by a regular microphone and suggest the person to tighten or loose the string to meet the ideal frequency.
